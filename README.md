This is my own website in development. The main reason why I find myself developing my site today, is in order to publish blogs, trying to share what I do as well as discuss, even give my ideas on some issues (talk about philosophy a bit).

> This project uses ReactJS, ThreeJS Fiber, and DREI (from ThreeJS Fiber).
